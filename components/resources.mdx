Alexa, the voice service that powers the Echo, provides capabilities, or skills, that enable customers to interact with devices in a more intuitive way using voice.

Examples of these skills include the ability to play music, answer general questions, set an alarm or timer, and more. TheÂ Alexa Skills Kit(ASK) enables developers to easily build capabilities, called skills, for Alexa. ASK includes self-service APIs, documentation, templates, and code samples to get developers on a rapid road to publishing their Alexa skills.
